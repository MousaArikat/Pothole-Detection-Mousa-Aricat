Pothole Detection System
The Pothole Detection System is an AI-powered solution designed to identify and locate potholes in images using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The project aims to assist with road maintenance and infrastructure improvement by automating pothole detection.

Overview
This system takes an image as input, processes it using a trained YOLOv8 model, and outputs the same image with bounding boxes drawn around detected potholes. The solution also features a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) where users can upload images and visualize the results.

Objective
Detect potholes in road images accurately using computer vision techniques.
Reduce manual inspection efforts and provide an automated solution for road defect detection.
Technologies Used
YOLOv8: State-of-the-art object detection model for locating potholes in images.
Python: Programming language for building the model and application logic.
OpenCV: Used for image processing and visualization.
Tkinter: Built the GUI for an interactive user experience.
How It Works
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The system uses a dataset of annotated road images with pothole labels.
Images are preprocessed for model training.
Model Training:

The YOLOv8 model is trained on annotated images to detect potholes with high accuracy.
Data augmentation techniques were applied to improve model generalization.
GUI Implementation:

A GUI built with Tkinter allows users to:
Upload an image.
View the processed image with detected potholes highlighted by bounding boxes.
Output:

The processed image with pothole bounding boxes is displayed, showing the location of detected potholes.
Results
The model achieved high detection accuracy on the test dataset.
It successfully identifies potholes and visualizes them using bounding boxes.
Example outputs include are in the Images folder
Future Improvements
Enhance the model with a larger, more diverse dataset.
Extend functionality to real-time pothole detection in video streams.
Integrate GPS coordinates for detected potholes to assist road maintenance teams.
